The purpose of this project is to put into practice basic NLP concepts by developing some experiments, 
which hopefully, will be of use in answering the following questions:

- Given a written conversation between two persons, what are some appropriate representation to 
analyze it using NLP techniques? Some possibilities are: *Bag of Words*, *Word2vec*, *TF-IDF*.

- What text classification technique produces the best results when applied to written conversations? 
Combined with which representation?
